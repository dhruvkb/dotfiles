**.files** is a collection of my dotfiles, exported settings and other
configuration files, along with documentation on how to use them, published to
GitHub strictly for version control and backup purposes.

Real talk though, if you see something you like, feel free to use it in your
own dotfiles. If you find a better way to accomplish something, open an issue.

## Steps

00. Clone the repository to the home directory `~`.
    ```sh
    cd ~
    gh repo clone dhruvkb/dotfiles
    ```

00. **zsh setup**

    01. Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh).
    01. Install [Starship](https://starship.rs).
    01. Perform [Zsh setup](./zsh/README.md).

00. **vim**

    01. Install Vim (and preferably [MacVim](https://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/)).
    01. Perform [Vim setup](./vim/README.md).
