**.files** is a collection of my dotfiles, exported settings and other
configuration files, alongwith documentation on how to use them, published to
GitHub strictly for version control and backup purposes.

Real talk though, if you see something you like, feel free to use it in your
own dotfiles. If you find a better way to accomplish something, open an issue.
