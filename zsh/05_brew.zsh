# Homebrew configuration
# ======================

# The `brew` plugin for Oh My Zsh handles shellenv, so this is not needed.
# eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"


# Use Brew cURL instead of macOS's built-in older version
# Run `brew install curl` to install it
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"
