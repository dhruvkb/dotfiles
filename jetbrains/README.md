# Steps

After install all required/preferred IDEs via Toolbox, perform these steps.

## Install Solarized theme

Install the correct [Solarized Themes](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12784-solarized-themes)
plugin from the Settings panel.

## Change the console colors

The Solarized theme uses the same colors in the bright variants, and that
[doesn't sit well with Vim](https://github.com/4lex4/intellij-platform-solarized/issues/18).
Import the attached `.icls` into the IDE. That should fix Vim in the terminal.
